# OB-SX-MagicBox-Editor

- A hardware editor to talk to the MagicBox Oberheim OB-SX interface over MIDI

This editor was built to control an Oberheim OB-SX synthesizer fitted with a MagicBox interface.

It uses MIDI CC messages to control all the functions that the MagicBox unlocks in the OB-SX

I developed ths blind with no access to an OB-SX or MagicBox to test with

This repo was setup to allow collaboration between Bernd Bruing and myself to resolve issues.
